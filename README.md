## Software

TODO fill up list

- `GNU Radio` (TODO)
- `SDR#` (TODO)

## Lingo

- `Receiver` A device that can only receive. Usually cheaper.
- `Transceiver` A device that can both send and receive.
- `Half duplex` Means that a device that can send and receive can either send or receive, but not at the same time. Usually cheaper.
- `Full duplex` Means that a device that can send and receive can do so simultaneously. Usually more expensive.

## Other Devices
